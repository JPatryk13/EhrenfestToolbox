# EhrenfestToolbox
MATLAB toolbox I made for my dissertation project on my Engineering Physics course. It was utilised to present the data from the investigation of the Ehrenfest Paradox. It provides classes for plotting a simple geometry and for numerical analysis applied in the Relativistic Quantum Mechanical system.
